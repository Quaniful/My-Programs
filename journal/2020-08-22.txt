I had a long weekend, to be honest I didn't really want to see anybody. I ended up being with Janie for a few days and seeing Orel, Adi and Diana too.

I think there are some lessons I need to take from this week... first of all, don't do anything you don't want to, don't invite people over if you want quiet, don't spend time with your girlfriend if you are not into it. Why? well, first - you won't enjoy! second, you'll start building impatience which can turn into resentment for them, which they do not deserve. Second, it can take away from your weekend time which is the opportunity to reset and prepare for the upcoming week.

Also, in the past few weeks I have shoved my opinions on to people's throats, sometimes even to the people I love most. I have argued with Omer about whether Nike products are worth the markup in price, I have yesterday argued with Diana that cigarettes addiction is the result of the nicotine addiction and that nicotine is a substance more addictive than heroine, I have argued with my Mom about many stuff, I even tried to resist Yigal's opinions about having a degree (the person has multiple degrees, who am I arguing with?)

It is great that I have gone and studied many facts and learned a lot, more than that I am convinced that in most of these cases, my opinion was the more truthful, BUT WHO CARES?

All that arguing is doing is make people resent you, make you resent them and pull one apart from the others. Now, there are times that one needs to stand up for what he believes in, but that is NOT anytime and NOT anywhere and NOT with anyone!

Arguing needs to be a very, very, very rare occasion and I intend to change my behavior to reflect that.

There are no winners in an argument - only 2 or more losers. And it only takes ONE person to end an argument.

I also wanna note another phenomena that happened, because I didn't really want to be with anybody this weekend, I was passive to people, not responsive and barely listenning, I was unenthusiastic and nothing other people had to say made me genuinely care and take interest.

That is not going to become the norm. First, I must become more active, I think that doing sports is missing, too much sitting and convenience... and I must take genuine interest in other people and in other fields rather than the ones I am in or I study.

So to sum it up - meet with people when you feel you want to, do not argue with people, it's unnecessary and wrong - it never ends well, speak positively and take genuine interest in others.
