the most important thing in life, by far, is health. you are nothing without your health, we need to thank god every single day for our physical health, our mental health and spiritual health.

I've had a rough patch this week, my mind hasn't stopped racing, the more it races - the more panic I feel and the more it races. I pray to God and I ask for his help. I've had panic attacks before in my life and I saw other who did too, I can win. 

All I have to do is to take care of myself, pray and everything will be okay.

Thank you God for always being there for me, I know that everything that ever happens - happens for me, with personal attention from you.

God knows I have hurt myself, I have not taken care of mind, body and spirit and I need to wake up. I realize now that there is nothing more important, without our health we are nothing.

I have let my emotions run wild, I have not given a minute of rest to myself, I have differentiated myself from all other human beings and gotten drunk of ideas, I have been fooling myself to believe I am somehow superior to other human beings, I'm sad to admit that so many things I did in the past 1 or 2 years were a complete show, I don't know which fact is worse - that I fooled myself or that I fooled others, I have played a game trying to create a perfect image of myself to the world - I failed.

I have had some amazing experiences and many, many good things along the way also, I remember now that everything is happening for me and for a good reason. Everything that happened has made me believe that we can achieve our dreams and gave me inspiration. The best thing that has happened is that I have fallen in love with Janie, I love this girl so much... and I finally appreciate her for who she is, I feel big shame for not appreciating her sooner, I am fearful that she might reject me if she knew that for a long time I wasn't sure of my love to her. I have taken many bad habits from her in the beginning, which made me resent this relationship, while I was debating with myself, fighting whether to continue with it or not, I somehow always managed to get another and another good feeling that kept me going, and I'm thankful I did, I am seeing myself falling in love with her even more and more as time will go on.

I also learned that no matter how hard I'll try, I can't change the fact that we human beings are social creatures, I believe that trying to avoid this fact and excelling at so many individual aspects of life have harmed my self esteem and has harmed my mental health. I am ready now to open my heart again, I am ready to give love and be part of the world.

As I'm writing this, I feel relieved, I know that God hears my prayers aI wanna say that I'm sorry, I have done wrong in so many things, God please help me make amends and please let my good heart show, I just want to be myself and to be good.

We human beings are so faulty sometimes, but in our hearts there is a fire, a strong, burning fire that shines on the world, we are good inside, we really are... we just have to reach out above to God so he can help us spark what we have in our core - pure good.
