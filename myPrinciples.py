Look to this day!
For it is life, the very life of life.
In its brief course
Lie all the verities and realities of your existence:
    The bliss of growth
    The glory of action
    The splendor of beauty,
For yesterdays is but a dream
And tomorrow is only a vision,
But today well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness
    And every tomorrow a vision of hope.
Look well, therefore, to this day!
Such is the salutation to the dawn.
